Copper Coffee Brochure Website

The idea behind this project is to drive customer traffic to the store. The shop is cosey with a great vintage aesthetic, however all the   
seating is located upstairs in a room not visable from the street. This site not only needs to promote the shops existance but also
compentate for issues in its physical design by informing people who are looking it up out of curiosity/ questioning is suitablility as a
place to meet.

UX

After consultation with the client the following has been layed out as the plan for the webiste (and its reasoning)

firstly the vintage wallpaper of the shop will be a dominant background as it is integral to the identity, or at least the look, of the shop. the UX problem 
this causes is that, as it is busy, it makes it difficult to read text against it. As a measure against this a class will be created with a contrasting colour 
and text shadow. [edit, this has been done by time of CI deadline, I am not entirely satisfied but will present to client for aproval of a mass redesign]

The opening page will have a navbar and a carousel of scrolling images showing the other pages. The idea behind this is firstly, that it gives
the opening page some movement, prompting people to look around. also, the shops aesthetic is one of its best features however, it may be jarring 
to move from home to gallery skipping over the "about us" page. This way the logical order is provided in the navbar but should people care more
about how the place they are drinking coffee looks, then the carousel offers a more free form route around the site, hopefully gaining the customers
interst enough for them to stop back to the about us page for further reason to visit. 

The about us page will contain text describing the formation of the shop, under that, there will be images of the staff. This shop is very 
community focused and the propriotor would like to offer a more personal relationship with his customers. to save space this area will contain 
pictures that flip around to reveal the information about the staff. finally there will be a geolocator and list of opening and closing times.
there will be a drop down menu with a jump to feature from the about button on the navbar to aid navigation. helping people find the shop is a 
high priority but maps themselve are not aesthetically pleasing. making it easy to navigate to with the dropdown while not having it front and 
center on the about page seems the best compromise. [Edit, this map looked out of place so has been scapped, as such so has the dropdown menu]

The gallery will contain static images. I didn't want to reuse the carousel as its been established as a means of navigation earlier in the site 
so using it again without this feature may be confusing to users. [Edit, useful pictures were not provided by CI deadline so an image has been used
as a place holder to show I can place images on the page with even spacing]

The contact us page will be a form with text to the effect of "we love to colaberate" / "if you would just like to ask us some questions" under this 
I will put another geolocator and list of open times as a prompt to come to the shop to ask these questions in person should they prefer. having 
done research it seems 50/50 if the map is in the about us section or contact us section. theres no harm in repeating this and its important that
everyone be able to find this info. 

color scheme and typography, set by the client is currently based on matching that of the shop "with a lighter feel" [Edit, I will be aproaching the 
client with intent to change the colour scheme as it is a bit overwelming]

there will be a footer containing copywrite, links to social media and excepted cards/e-wallet payment options. 

all pages that contain multiple sections will have overlap so the second section that may require scrolling is visible from the preceding section. this 
will mean no info is missed.

[Edit, at time of submission client had no social media operational so links go to log in pages for those sites as placeholders]

User Stories:

As a user, I wanted to find the map and opening times, navigation was easy enough and it was in a logical place.
As a user, I wanted to learn more about the staff. the flipping cards was not obvious and this may be considered a bug should more users find the same thing

Testing
all links functional
all navigation works
responsive design when changing down screen sizes.


Features Left to Implement
In future I want to wrap all text and buttons in picture frames with plain backgrounds so they will have no visibility problems against the wallpaper.
A widget so the gallery is generated from instagram
An e-commerce page selling merch.
