Copper Coffee Brochure Website

The idea behind this project is to drive customer traffic to the store. The shop is cosey with a great vintage aesthetic, however all the   
seating is located upstairs in a room not visable from the street. This site not only needs to promote the shops existance but also
compentate for issues in its physical design by informing people who are looking it up out of curiosity/ questioning is suitablility as a
place to meet.

UX

The opening page will have a navbar and a carousel of scrolling images showing the other pages. the idea behind this is firstly, that it gives
the opening page some movement, prompting people to look around. also, the shops aesthetic is one of its best features however, it may be jarring 
to move from home to gallery skipping over the "about us" page. This way the logical order is provided in the navbar but should people care more
about how the place they are drinking coffee looks, then the carousel offers a more free form route around the site, hopefully gaining the customers
interst enough for them to stop back to the about us page for further reason to visit. 

The about us page will contain text describing the formation of the shop, under that, there will be images of the staff. This shop is very 
community focused and the propriotor would like to offer a more personal relationship with his customers. to save space this area will contain 
pictures that flip around to reveal the information about the staff. finally there will be a geolocator and list of opening and closing times.
there will be a drop down menu with a jump to feature from the about button on the navbar to aid navigation. helping people find the shop is a 
high priority but maps themselve are not aesthetically pleasing. making it easy to navigate to with the dropdown while not having it front and 
center on the about page seems the best compromise. 

the gallery will contain static images. I didn't want to reuse the carousel as its been established as a means of navigation earlier in the site 
so using it again without this feature may be confusing to users.

The contact us page will be a form with text to the effect of "we love to colaberate" / "if you would just like to ask us some questions" under this 
I will put another geolocator and list of open times as a prompt to come to the shop to ask these questions in person should they prefer. having 
done research it seems 50/50 if the map is in the about us section or contact us section. theres no harm in repeating this and its important that
everyone be able to find this info. 

color scheme and typography is currently based on matching that of the shop, however, this may change if a clashing colorscheme would help the pictures
pop. 

ideally how it would work 

there will be a footer containing copywrite, links to social media and excepted cards/e-wallet payment options. 

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
